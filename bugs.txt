unfixed:

	2: Text.wholeText or for that matter $(Text).text() of a split text node returns the entire text of the normalized nodes.
		eg: text -> "lol"
			text1 = text.splitText(1);
			text1.wholeText === text.wholeText -> true

		Fix: don't use the text() to wrap the text node, simply clone it, delete the content of the previous and append the clone

	3: inserting element in contentEditable sets the caret before the inserted element
